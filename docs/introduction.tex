\textbf{Inverted Index and Comparative Analysis of Data Structures} is a project developed as part of the second assessment for the Data Structures course in the Applied Mathematics program at FGV.

The project's goal is to demonstrate proficiency in the C++ programming language by applying concepts covered throughout the classes. To this end, different tree-based data structures are implemented—including \textbf{Binary Search Tree (BST)}, \textbf{AVL}, and \textbf{Red-Black Tree (RBT)}—in order to analyze their behavior and performance in building an inverted index.

The inverted index consists of associating words with lists of documents in which they appear, also allowing for the alphabetical ordering of these words. The project, therefore, focuses on comparing the efficiency of the different trees in terms of insertion, sorting, and searching within this context.
